**Data Science For Fintech Industries(Cryptocurreny)**

The goal is to provide a brief introduction of FinTech Industries and an easy way to
cryptocurrency analysis using Python and R. We will walk through a simple Python and
R script to retrieve, analyze, and visualize data on cryptocurrencies using data science
feature like scrapping data set using Quandl API, exploratory data analysis in python
and various graphical representation of real time bitcoin data in R.

This presentation will help you in understanding

1.	The types of datasets used by Financial Industries mainly Cryptocurrency to predict any future results.
2.	Websites to look for financial datasets.
3.	 In what all formats the data is available
4.	Once we have the data, how to proceed with the analysis?
5.	What to do when data is not available in the structured format Ways to extract data- Web Scraping using HTML inspection and Using    Quandl APIs.
6.	Performing Exploratory Data Analysis: Getting to know all the variables and columns of the csv file. 
7.	Cleaning data- Available data will be dirty most of the time and hence need cleaning to begin with any further processing.
8.	A practical example (R and Python) on how to perform the above steps.
